                            Web page development is the process of creating and designing individual web pages that collectively form a website. 
                It involves a combination of coding, design, and content creation to produce a visually appealing, interactive, 
                and functional online platform. At its core, web page development relies on languages like 
                HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. 
                Developers work on both the front-end and back-end aspects of web pages. 
                Front-end development focuses on what users see and interact with directly, 
                while back-end development manages data storage, processing, and server communication.
